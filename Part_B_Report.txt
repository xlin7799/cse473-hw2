1. Nuo Chen, Xin Lin
2. Original HMM parameters:
    a. Total count of correctly tagged words in the test data:  34896.0
    b. Total count of words in the test data:  73523.0
    c. Percentage correct (calculated from the previous two values):  47.46
3. HMM parameters with Laplace smoothing:
    a. Total count of correctly tagged words in the test data:  71221.0
    b. Total count of words in the test data:  73523.0
    c. Percentage correct (calculated from the previous two values):  96.87
4. Something you learned doing this assignment:
    It is very cool to use a model we created to predict the words type! We have a better understanding about the HMM model and a new method - laplace smoothing
5. Biggest challenge you faced doing this assignment:
    The biggest challenge is understanding the structure of existing code
